# Files

This directory contains the instrumentation and utilities
for an OpenBSD laptop.

The directory tree is created by the `savesys` script,
the `sys` directory tree has the system files.

The file `savesys.list` contains the listing of all the files
with their attributes. Files coming from git might not have
attributes so using an another script `setprot` can restore
them to their original state.
