    Quantis random number interface

This is a simple interface to the Quantis random number generator.
This device is manufactured by id Quantique, a small Swiss company.
It is a hardware random number generator giving true random numbers
in the sense of quantum mechanics.

OpenBSD uses /etc/random.seed and /var/db/host.random for entropy.

The program works only with the USB version and can have only one
device connected. It is based on the original Quantis code but
drastically simplified. It consists of a library and an example
program. The sample program prints random numbers in various formats.
The library implements a simple interface using LIBUSB calls.
It uses the synchronous version of the LIBUSB interface.
Builds static and shared versions of the library. The library also
has a sample test program.

This directory contains:

Makefile            is the make faile to build the library and the
                    sample program / utility.
README              this readme file.
include             is a directory contains the library header file
                    (qusb.h).
lib                 is a directory with the library code. Builds
                    static and shared versions of the library.
qrandom.c           is the sample utility program.
qrandom.man         manual page for the utility.
qrandom             is the executable built.
qrngd.c             simple daemon to run in the background and inject
                    random data into the entropy pool at times.
qrngd.man           is the manual page for the daemon.
qrngd               executable.

The make file is prepared only for OpenBSD and FreeBSD but it is
fairly generic so it should work with most unix-type systems.
The targets are:
all                 default target, build everything.
test                run tests.
install             install library, executable and manual pages.
uninstall           undo the install.
clean               clean up
distclean           clean up
clobber				clean up
lib                 builds the library.
libtest             run library tests.
libinstall          install library. This is necessary only when
                    the shared library is in use.
libuninstall        undo the install.

The library has got a make file in the library directory, will
also build a utility program for testing the library. In the
library subdirectory:
Makefile            to build the library.
qusb.c              source file for the library.
qusb.man            manual pages for the test / utility program.
