    Fingerprint

Build the fingerprint login style.
  cd /usr/ports/sysutils/login_fingerprint
  make
That will build and install libfprint 8.2 which
in fact does not work. At least not for the UPEK I got.
But it gives the source for those.
  cd /usr/ports/security/libfprint
  make deinstall

Use the files from the FreeBSD 11 ports directory tree
which would be libfprint version 0.7.0.
  cd fingerprint/fprint-freebsd-11
  cd src
  tar -z -xf ../tar/libfprint.tar.gz
  cd libfprint-0.7.0

It is prepared to compile now. Since this was lifted
from an already built system the patches are already done.
In case you would need the patches:
  patch < ../../files/patch-config.h.in
  patch < ../../files/patch-libfprint-drivers-vfs301.c
  patch < ../../files/patch-libfprint-drivers-vfs301_proto.c
  patch < ../../files/patch-libfprint-drivers-vfs301_proto.h
  patch < ../../files/patch-libfprint_Makefile.in

Then the usual:
  make clean
  ./configure --disable-udev-rules
  make
It will fail when it tries to deal with the udev rules. We have
no udev on OpenBSD. So this needs to be disabled in the make file.
Also try compile with gcc and -O0.
Re-run and then:
  make install
will also put files under /usr/local/libdata/pkgconfig which is
a FreeBSD thing I presume it should be OK.
We should have libfprint now.
