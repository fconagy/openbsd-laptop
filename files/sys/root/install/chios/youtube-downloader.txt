    Youtube downloader

The old youtube-dl is dead. A fork which works is
  https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

Get the tarball and build and non-root.
  wget https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp.tar.gz
  tar -z -xf yt-dlp.tar.gz
  cd yt-dlp
  gmake clean
  gmake yt-dlp
  gmake yt-dlp.1
This should build the python script-executable.
  cp yt-dlp ~/local/bin/
  cp yt-dlp.1 ~/local/man/man1/
The ydl script should work just the same as before.
