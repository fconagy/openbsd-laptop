# Xservers file, workstation prototype
#
# This file should contain an entry to start the server on the
# local display; if you have more than one display (not screen),
# you can add entries to the list (one per line).  If you also
# have some X terminals connected which do not support XDMCP,
# you can add them here as well.  Each X terminal line should
# look like:
#	XTerminalName:0 foreign
#
#:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -noreset -background none -br :0 vt05
#:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -background none -br -noreset :0 vt05
# Try to add -dpi.
:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -nolisten tcp -background none -br :0 vt05
# !!!! Second virtual. Does not work. Freeze.
